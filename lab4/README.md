## 5. Conclusions

### 5.1 Key Findings

Using the parallel version of bubble sort does in fact speed up the algorithm execution.
With small datasets more threads seem to perform a bit worse, but increase in data sets sees a quite substantial
speedup.
Speedup sees to not follow linear increase but taper and slow down a bit with larger data sets.

### 5.2 Limitations and Challenges

Thread creation and usage with smaller datasets is more expensive, so more threads here does provide a good speedup.
The bubble sort algorithm itself is not efficient using large datasets, so to have more efficient sorting with large
data it would be better to use different algorithms, not just parallelization.
