# Laboratory assignment 1

Goal of this laboratory exercise is to deepen understanding of parallel computing critical section.
To achieve this goal this task entails creating a real world computation simulation that suffers from the data race problem and how to solve it.

### Project: Logging to a file.

Imagine you have a system where multiple threads are logging messages to a file.
Without proper synchronization, the log messages could get mixed up and result in a corrupted log file.
