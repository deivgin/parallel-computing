# Bubble sort parallel implementation

## Motivation

The purpose of the assignment is to design and implement efficient parallel algorithm for bubble sort algorithm using
shared memory multithreaded parallel system and experimentally investigate the speedup and scalability of the
application.

## Problem

This program seeks to use bubble sort algorithm to sort massive amount of data - 1 mil random integer numbers to be precise.
Typically this is done in about 0.000166 milliseconds. If there
